# Layer 2 working group

Welcome to the documentation repository of the Layer 2 working group. It holds defining documents like the working group charter and procedural documentation like meeting notes.

> [!NOTE]
> This was the "Hydra" working group before and we expanded the scope in June 2025. While we had often had conversations across various layer 2 projects, agenda items and meeting notes if not otherwise mentioned were about Hydra.

## Charter

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The charter was updated when we moved the changed scope of the working group.

### Why

> Why is this working group needed?

- Ensure interoperability across the various emerging Layer 2 projects
- Break up silos and cross-pollinate projects across the broader domain of scaling Cardano transaction processing
- Identify and scope _fundable features_ and projects related to Layer 2 technology to be ratified by the community (e.g. through intersect)
- Open discussion and governance of the [hydra](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra) project roadmap

### What

> What are we doing concretely?

- Share progress and gather feedback on individual project deliveries
- Discuss standards and [Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIPs)](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs) related to layer 2
- Prioritize and get feedback for individual project features (e.g. [Hydra features](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20type%3AFeature))
- Chat about new layer 2 catalyst proposals and long term layer 2 projects, for example Midgard, zkFold, subbit, Cardano Lightning, μgraph, ...

> [!WARNING]
