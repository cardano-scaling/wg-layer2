## Meeting notes

- **Hydra Performance Issues:** Hinson Wong raised concerns about Hydra node
  downtime due to CPU throttling on GCP, leading to network disruptions.
  Sebastian Nagel suggested restarting affected machines and noted that recent
  Hydra versions (22.3/4 and 23.x) have fixed memory issues.

- **"Midnight Thing":** Elaine Cardenas inquired about the "midnight thing,"
  which Sebastian explained was the Midnight Glacial Drop event, a high-load
  battle-testing environment for Hydra.

- **Cardano Lightning and L2 Diversity:** Dominic (waalge) discussed Cardano
  Lightning, a payment-focused L2 aiming for feature parity with Bitcoin's
  Lightning Network. He emphasized that L2s should be use-case specific and
  highlighted differences in HTLC (Hashed Timelock Contract) implementation
  compared to Bitcoin.
  - Project links from Dominic: https://subbit.xyz/ and https://cardano-lightning.org/

- **Interoperability and Standardization:** The discussion moved to the need for
  interoperability between different L2 technologies, including cross-L2 ledger
  communication. George Flerovsky stressed the trade-offs between
  general-purpose and app-specific L2s, and the importance of open discussion in
  the Layer 2 Working Group Discord channel.
  - Relevant catalyst project looking for contributors: https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/cardano/idea/130826
  - HTLCs on EUTxO ledgers: https://cardano-scaling.github.io/eutxo-l2-interop/ms1/index.html#htlc-payment

- **HTLC Definitions and Interoperability:** A debate ensued regarding the
  definition and implementation of HTLCs across different L2s (e.g.,
  Hydra/Midgard vs. Cardano Lightning). The group considered how
  interoperability could work with these differing approaches.
   - More general definition of HTLCs, applicable across different blockchain ledgers and even traditional systems: https://interledger.org/developers/rfcs/hashed-timelock-agreements/

- **Future Discussion:** Sebastian Nagel concluded by proposing that future
  meetings focus on common denominators or standards for L2 interoperability
  within the community, particularly concerning off-chain payment processing.

## Action items

- [ ] George and Dominic: Will host next meeting (Aug 13) and discuss interledger stuff further
- [ ] Chairs: Topic for Aug 27 will be a more official discussion and vote whether we can zero-in on some standardization?
