## Meeting notes

- Co-Chair Search: Sebastian Nagel, the current chair, is looking for co-chairs for the working group. George Flerovsky volunteers to step up.

- Hydra Use Case - Midnight Glacier Drop: Sebastian explains how Hydra is being used in the Midnight Glacier Drop for processing a large number of claims (potentially millions). The architecture involves a Hydra head run by five operators, a replicated PostgreSQL database for claims, and the use of Merkel trees for on-chain commitments. The design focuses on a limited number of UTXOs to ensure tractability and resilience, with multiple instances of Hydra nodes for high availability.

- Resilience and Fault Testing: The group discusses the importance of resilience and fault injection testing for Layer 2 systems, noting that Hydra has been put to the test with the Midnight project. George expresses interest in applying similar testing to Hydrozoa.

- Hydrozoa Project: George introduces Hydrozoa, a project aimed at simplifying Layer 1 mechanisms for Hydra. Hydrozoa focuses on using multi-sign transactions without Plutus scripts when peers agree on L2 state, with Plutus only being involved if consensus breaks down. A key feature is the ability to efficiently and scalably release state on L1, overcoming UTXO constraints through a "roll out" mechanism using BLS accumulators for partial fan out.

- Interoperability and Payment Channels: The discussion touches on inter-head interoperability and the potential for building Lightning-like payment channel networks on Cardano, possibly using HTLC transfers between heads.

- Local Currency Use Case: Elaine Cardenas from the Open Source Committee (OSC) discusses a local currency project in Japan that is considering Hydra for its privacy benefits and fast transactions. They are also weighing it against Midnight, acknowledging Midnight's current latency but potential for an easier MVP.
